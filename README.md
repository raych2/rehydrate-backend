# Rehydrate

This is an API that stores quiz questions and will eventually serve an associated React web app.  Routes were tested and the initial 5 questions were added using Postman.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to update a former hackathon project (https://devpost.com/software/rehydrate) from last summer, which was created using one of the hackathon sponsor's browser-based IDE.  I wanted to add the feature that my teammates and I weren't able to add, as well as utilize what I've learned since that time.  I gained more practice using Mongoose to make the Question schema, and sanitizing and validating the question/nested answer input with express-validator.
